    <p>The idea that a website can grow, rest, or even evaporate as a living thing, resonated with me. The treatment of websites as extensions of identity rather than static tools somewhat made sense to me immediately upon reading the article. If I had to describe my own website, I would add on to the garden metaphor as a seed planted in late fall, a place where ideas are planted without pressure to bloom immediately. Although I am new to making websites, and infusing life inside it, I believe the logic and pacing I put into websites allow me to control the emotional tone of the experience. Without any constraints by templates or guides, it lets me experience and leave things unresolved for me to simply indulge in a space that evolves alongside my thinking.
