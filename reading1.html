        This article made me think about restaurant websites as cultural artifacts rather than functional tools. What Toph Tucker and Jasmine Lee point out so well is how older, hand-built restaurant websites carried a sense of personality, labor, and care that mirrored the physical experience of being in the restaurant itself. The imperfections including odd fonts, clunky animations, text-heavy menus weren’t flaws overall, but rather an evidence of a human hand, signaling that the restaurant was run by people with specific tastes rather than optimized for algorithms or platforms.

    </p>I found the discussion about platforms especially compelling. The shift toward Google Maps, Yelp, Instagram, and Facebook has undeniably made information more accessible, but it’s also flattened how restaurants present themselves. These platforms separate content from form, which makes updating easier but strips away expressive control. The article highlights how modern CMS tools prioritize efficiency and uniformity, often at the expense of atmosphere, narrative, and experimentation. What’s lost isn’t just aesthetics, but the ability to convey time, seasonality, relationships between dishes, or even the labor behind the food.
