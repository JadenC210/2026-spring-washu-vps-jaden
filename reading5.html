    <p>Watching Eno, I was inspired by Eno’s quote on how feelings are the starting point for all of his work. Even with his structured systems of no-but sessions or the use of chance, everything began with an emotional impulse for him. And for Eno, successful work would be defined by the accurate translation of that emotion into his songs. His approach to creation resonated with me, because in my own practice I often begin with a feeling I can’t fully articulate and then build the work around it. Just like how his craftsmanship demonstrated careful shaping of emotion through process, repetition, and experimentation, I was encouraged to trust my own emotional instincts while building frameworks that allow ideas to evolve.
