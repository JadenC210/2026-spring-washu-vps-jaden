        I found the article especially persuasive in how it shifts the conversation from whether something was made by AI to whether it feels meaningfully human. Rather than framing AI as a simple threat or cheat, the author argues that the real danger lies in how easily we accept work that is generic, contextless, and emotionally empty, regardless of whether they are produced by humans or machines. The example images from the article highlight how this ambiguity can feel like a form of gaslighting, where audiences are simultaneously told they are being deceived and that the deception shouldn’t matter.

</p>What resonated most with me was the emphasis on expressiveness as a new kind of Turing test: work that comes from someone, is meant for someone, and belongs to a specific context. It appeared as the author was trying to keep reminding us that art and writing are valuable because they transmit lived experience and intent, not because they merely appear competent or polished. In that sense, the piece feels less like a warning about AI and more like a challenge to creators. As machines get better at imitation, the responsibility to be curious, situated, and visibly human becomes even more important.
