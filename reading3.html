    <p>The article frames two futures of interaction between human and computer. One scenario is modifying the human to fit technology, with the second as the environment being reshaped to support human cognition. By directly contrasting cyborg-like augmentation with room scale environments, the author delineates how wearable and implants prioritize constant individual optimization, while rooms emphasize shared and social interaction. In doing so, the author’s preference for “rooms” made me contemplate whether computing should live on us or around us, reminding me how I see myself adapt or get adapted by technology.
